Here is a 99-word sad love story:

Once upon a time, there was a young couple named Alex and Bella. They were deeply in love, and inseparable. They dreamed of getting married and having children together.

One day, Bella was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Alex was devastated, but he was determined to make the most of the time they had left together. They spent every waking moment together, cherishing every memory they made.

Despite their best efforts, Bella's condition worsened. Alex watched helplessly as the love of his life faded away. One day, Bella passed away peacefully in her sleep.

Alex was heartbroken. He felt like he had lost a part of himself. He withdrew from the world and fell into a deep depression.

One day, Alex was cleaning out Bella's belongings when he found a diary. He opened it and began to read. Bella had written about her love for him, and her hopes for their future.

Alex realized that he couldn't keep living in the past. He needed to move on and find a way to be happy again. He knew that Bella would want him to.

Alex started volunteering at a local hospice, helping other people who were grieving the loss of loved ones. He also started dating again, and eventually found love again.

Alex never forgot Bella. She would always hold a special place in his heart. But he knew that she would want him to be happy. And so, he moved forward with his life, carrying her love with him.
